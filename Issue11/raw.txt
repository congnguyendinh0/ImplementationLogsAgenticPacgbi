Nail design has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, with its origins rooted in ancient civilizations.  The art of nail design has evolved significantly over the years, influenced by cultural trends, fashion, and technological advancements. 

In ancient Egypt, both men and women adorned their nails with henna, a practice that symbolized wealth and status. The use of nail polish can be traced back to the Ming Dynasty in China, where a mixture of beeswax, egg whites, and colored powders was used to create beautiful nail colors.

As the centuries progressed, nail design became more sophisticated. The introduction of modern nail polish in the 20th century revolutionized the industry, allowing for a wider variety of colors and finishes. Today, nail design is not just a beauty trend but a form of self-expression, with techniques ranging from simple manicures to intricate nail art.

At HA Beauty, we celebrate the art of nail design by offering a range of services that highlight the beauty and creativity of our clients. Our skilled technicians are trained in the latest techniques and trends, ensuring that every client leaves feeling beautiful and confident.

Nail design has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, with its origins rooted in ancient civilizations.  The art of nail design has evolved significantly over the years, influenced by cultural trends, fashion, and technological advancements. 

In ancient Egypt, both men and women adorned their nails with henna, a practice that symbolized wealth and status. The use of nail polish can be traced back to the Ming Dynasty in China, where a mixture of beeswax, egg whites, and colored powders was used to create beautiful nail colors.

As the centuries progressed, nail design became more sophisticated. The introduction of modern nail polish in the 20th century revolutionized the industry, allowing for a wider variety of colors and finishes. Today, nail design is not just a beauty trend but a form of self-expression, with techniques ranging from simple manicures to intricate nail art.

At HA Beauty, we celebrate the art of nail design by offering a range of services that highlight the beauty and creativity of our clients. Our skilled technicians are trained in the latest techniques and trends, ensuring that every client leaves feeling beautiful and confident.

## Benefit Hypothesis

By enhancing the website’s branding in the footer and introducing a fresh, SEO-optimized article on nutrition for healthy lashes, we aim to increase user engagement and improve search engine visibility. Updating the footer will reinforce our brand identity, while the detailed article will provide valuable content to educate users on the connection between nutrition and lash health, optimized for search engines.

## Story Context

Currently, our footer displays outdated branding, and our content library lacks in-depth guidance on how nutrition impacts lash health. By updating the footer and adding a well-optimized article with human-readable metadata, we ensure that our website remains visually appealing and provides informative, easily editable content for our audience.

## Objective

The goal of this task is to enhance the user experience and search engine visibility by updating the website’s footer branding and adding a valuable, SEO-optimized article on nutrition for lash health. This update aims to:

Strengthen the brand’s identity through a modern, consistent footer design.
Improve search engine rankings by providing informative, keyword-optimized content.
Educate the audience on how nutrition supports lash health, encouraging better engagement and repeat visits.
## Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for Footer.tsx)
- **Languages**:
  - TypeScript (for Footer.tsx)
  - Markdown (for nutrition.md)
- **SEO Considerations**: Implement SEO best practices for crafting metadata (title and excerpt) for the article.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Footer Update (`Footer.tsx`)

- **Steps**:
  1. Open the `Footer.tsx` file.

  3. Replace each instance with "Ha Beauty Website."
  4. Test the updated footer for proper display and responsiveness across all devices.

### 2. Nutrition Article (`nutrition.md`)
- **Task**: Write a new article titled *Nutrition for Great Lashes: Essential Tips & Benefits*.
- **Metadata**:
  - **Title**: Nutrition for Great Lashes: Essential Tips & Benefits
  - **Excerpt**: Learn how proper nutrition can enhance your lash health with key vitamins, minerals, and dietary tips for longer, stronger lashes.
  - **Cover Image**: `/assets/Nutrition.png`
  - **Author**: Hang
  - **Author Picture**: `/assets/blog/authors/hang.png`
  - **Date**: Today
  - **OG Image**: `/assets/Nutrition.png`
  
- **Content Requirements**:
  - **Introduction**: Discuss the importance of nutrition in promoting lash health.
  - **Key Nutrients**: Explain essential vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids (e.g., Biotin, Vitamin E, Omega-3) for lash growth.
  - **Dietary Tips**: Offer practical advice and food recommendations for stronger lashes.
  - **Conclusion**: Summarize the benefits of proper nutrition and encourage readers to adopt these practices for healthier lashes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Footer Update**:
  - "Main Website" is replaced with "Ha Beauty Website" in `Footer.tsx`.
  - The updated footer is responsive and visually consistent with the website design.

- **Article in `nutrition.md`**:
  - Front matter is included with the following details:

Nail design has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, with its origins rooted in ancient civilizations.  The art of nail design has evolved significantly over the years, influenced by cultural trends, fashion, and technological advancements. 

In ancient Egypt, both men and women adorned their nails with henna, a practice that symbolized wealth and status. The use of nail polish can be traced back to the Ming Dynasty in China, where a mixture of beeswax, egg whites, and colored powders was used to create beautiful nail colors.

As the centuries progressed, nail design became more sophisticated. The introduction of modern nail polish in the 20th century revolutionized the industry, allowing for a wider variety of colors and finishes. Today, nail design is not just a beauty trend but a form of self-expression, with techniques ranging from simple manicures to intricate nail art.

Here's an improved version of your markdown:

## Benefit Hypothesis

By enhancing the website’s branding in the footer and introducing a fresh, SEO-optimized article on nutrition for healthy lashes, we aim to increase user engagement and improve search engine visibility. Updating the footer will reinforce our brand identity, while the detailed article will provide valuable content to educate users on the connection between nutrition and lash health, optimized for search engines.

## Story Context

Currently, our footer displays outdated branding, and our content library lacks in-depth guidance on how nutrition impacts lash health. By updating the footer and adding a well-optimized article with human-readable metadata, we ensure that our website remains visually appealing and provides informative, easily editable content for our audience.

## Objective

The goal of this task is to enhance the user experience and search engine visibility by updating the website’s footer branding and adding a valuable, SEO-optimized article on nutrition for lash health. This update aims to:

Strengthen the brand’s identity through a modern, consistent footer design.
Improve search engine rankings by providing informative, keyword-optimized content.
Educate the audience on how nutrition supports lash health, encouraging better engagement and repeat visits.
## Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for Footer.tsx)
- **Languages**:
  - TypeScript (for Footer.tsx)
  - Markdown (for nutrition.md)
- **SEO Considerations**: Implement SEO best practices for crafting metadata (title and excerpt) for the article.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Footer Update (`Footer.tsx`)
- **Task**: Replace "Main Website" with "Ha Beauty Website."
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the `Footer.tsx` file.
  2. Search for all occurrences of "Main Website."
  3. Replace each instance with "Ha Beauty Website."
  4. Test the updated footer for proper display and responsiveness across all devices.

### 2. Nutrition Article (`nutrition.md`)
- **Task**: Write a new article titled *Nutrition for Great Lashes: Essential Tips & Benefits*.
- **Metadata**:
  - **Title**: Nutrition for Great Lashes: Essential Tips & Benefits
  - **Excerpt**: Learn how proper nutrition can enhance your lash health with key vitamins, minerals, and dietary tips for longer, stronger lashes.
  - **Cover Image**: `/assets/Nutrition.png`
  - **Author**: Hang
  - **Author Picture**: `/assets/blog/authors/hang.png`
  - **Date**: Today
  - **OG Image**: `/assets/Nutrition.png`
  
- **Content Requirements**:
  - **Introduction**: Discuss the importance of nutrition in promoting lash health.
  - **Key Nutrients**: Explain essential vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids (e.g., Biotin, Vitamin E, Omega-3) for lash growth.
  - **Dietary Tips**: Offer practical advice and food recommendations for stronger lashes.
  - **Conclusion**: Summarize the benefits of proper nutrition and encourage readers to adopt these practices for healthier lashes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Footer Update**:
  - "Main Website" is replaced with "Ha Beauty Website" in `Footer.tsx`.
  - The updated footer is responsive and visually consistent with the website design.

- **Article in `nutrition.md`**:
  - Front matter is included with the following details:
    - **Title**: Nutrition for Great Lashes: Essential Tips & Benefits
    - **Excerpt**: Learn how proper nutrition can enhance your lash health with key vitamins, minerals, and dietary tips for longer, stronger lashes.
    - **Cover Image**: `/assets/Nutrition.png`
    - **Author**: Hang with the picture located at `/assets/blog/authors/hang.png`
    - **Date**: Today
    - **OG Image**: `/assets/Nutrition.png`
  - The article is well-structured, informative, and optimized for SEO.

- **Overall**:
  - The updated footer and new article display correctly across all devices.

## Introduction

Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in promoting lash health. Just like our hair, our lashes require essential nutrients to grow strong and healthy. In this article, we will explore the key nutrients that support lash growth and provide dietary tips to help you achieve beautiful lashes.

## Key Nutrients

1. **Biotin**: Known as the "beauty vitamin," biotin is essential for the growth of hair and nails, including lashes. It helps strengthen the lash follicles and promotes healthy growth.

2. **Vitamin E**: This powerful antioxidant helps protect the lashes from damage and supports overall lash health. It also improves blood circulation to the hair follicles.

3. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, omega-3s nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy lash growth.

## Dietary Tips

- Incorporate foods rich in biotin, such as eggs, nuts, and whole grains, into your diet.
- Include sources of vitamin E, like spinach, avocados, and almonds, to support lash health.
- Add omega-3-rich foods to your meals, such as salmon, chia seeds, and walnuts.

## Conclusion

By adopting a balanced diet rich in these essential nutrients, you can enhance your lash health and achieve longer, stronger lashes. Remember, healthy lashes start from within, so make sure to nourish your body with the right foods!

================
```

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Footer Update**: The footer in `Footer.tsx` has been updated to ensure that "Main Website" is replaced with "Ha Beauty Website."
2. **Nutrition Article**: A new markdown file `nutrition.md` has been created with the specified title, excerpt, metadata, and content that discusses the importance of nutrition for lash health.

These changes have been made while preserving the formatting of the original `repomix-output.txt` file.
